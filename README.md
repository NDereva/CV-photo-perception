# CV-photo-perception

The project was inspired by this [blogpost](https://cutt.ly/2GIFSk7) (in russian).
The idea is that they make questionnaire to check how CV photo influence on the subjective perception of candidate competency.
They claim that subtle smile on candidate's CV photo, slightly increase the perception of candidate competency
However, the blogpost lack of any kind of statistical data analysis and relies only on descriptive statistics.

So I did the stats just for fun. 

I have tried to doublecheck everythinkg to avoid any errors.  
I cannot garantee though that my code is error/bug free. If you found any flaw or you have a suggestion - please contact me.
